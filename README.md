### DEMO page
[DEMO](http://jedlikk.github.io/jedliSlider/)

### What is jedliSlider?

jedliSlider is lightweight carousel with multiple options and modes to use on your page, created in pure (vanilla) javascript and css.

### Compatibility

Slider is built on css flexbox. So will be compatible with every browser that supports flexbox.

### Why jedliSlider?

Because itâ€™s lightweight, easy to use, modern and will have all options that you want. Some popular carousels still use floats and a lot of unnecessary scripts/styles. My intention was to create one slider, that will contain all things i missed in other carousels. With as low code and css as possible. So you don't need to override some default styles and download multiple libraries for specific types of carousels.

## Status
There are currently two working modes:

continuous - fully implemented
default - partial support, (check available options on [DEMO page](http://jedlikk.github.io/jedliSlider/#options))

## What's new?
### v. 0.7.7

- #defaultMode - Added functionality for 'go to next slide'
- #defaultMode - Added functionality for 'go to prev slide'
