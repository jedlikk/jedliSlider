### DEMO page
[DEMO](http://jedlikk.github.io/jedliSlider/)

### What is jedliSlider?

jedliSlider is interactive carousel with multiple options and modes to use on your page, created in pure (vanilla) javascript and css.

### Compatibility

Slider is built on css flexbox. So will be compatible with every browser that supports flexbox.

### Why jedliSlider?

Because itâ€™s easy to use, modern and will have all options that you want. Some popular carousels still use floats and a lot of unnecessary scripts/styles. My intention was to create one slider, that will contain all things i missed in other carousels. With as low code and css as possible. So you don't need to override some default styles and download multiple libraries for specific types of carousels.

## Status
There are currently two working modes:

- continuous - fully implemented
- default - check available options on [DEMO page](http://jedlikk.github.io/jedliSlider/#options)

## What's new?
### v. 0.12.19
- Fixed bug with 'auto' width of slides in 'countinous' mode after last update

### Previous update
- Added functionality to filter slides, show all or only from wanted category, with option to
    change category to show [See example here](http://jedlikk.github.io/jedliSlider/#filtering)
- Added events 'dragStart', 'dragEnd
- Added functionality to keep dragging slider when mouse is outside slider box
- Fixed bug when after drag there is no visible slides. Slider will now reset to first/last slide
- Fixed bug with dragging, and blocking of slider when slider was at start/end with infinite
    option set to fals

### Features soon:

- Creating dots from options
- Creating dots with custom html
- Custom animation of changing slides
- Lazy load for images
- 'Centered' mode, where some slides are bigger, smaller or highlighted by other way, with some levels of highlightness and animation between levels
